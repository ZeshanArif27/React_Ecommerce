# React E-Commerce Store with Laravel Backend

Welcome to the React E-Commerce Store repository! In this project, we've combined the power of React.js and Laravel to create a robust e-commerce store.

## Project Overview

- **React.js Frontend:** Our frontend is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a responsive and interactive shopping experience for your customers.

- **Laravel Backend:** Laravel, a PHP web application framework, serves as the backend of our e-commerce store. It handles routing, database interactions, and business logic to ensure a seamless shopping experience.

- **MySQL Database:** We've integrated MySQL as our database system to store product information, customer data, and order details, ensuring data consistency and reliability.

## Key Features

1. **React Components:** We've organized our project into reusable React components for easy maintenance and scalability.

2. **Laravel Routing:** Laravel routes are used to manage navigation and retrieve data from the backend, ensuring secure and efficient data flow.

3. **Data Fetching:** React fetches data from Laravel routes, allowing us to present real-time product information, pricing, and availability to customers.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-ecommerce-store.git

2. Set up your Laravel environment by downloading the Larave_React_Ecommerce Repository.

3. Configure your database connection in Laravel to use MySQL.
  
5. Import the database file located in the public/db folder into your MySQL database.
  
6. Add Bootstrap CSS and JS CDN links to the public/index.html file for styling and layout.

7. Install the required dependencies for the React frontend:

   ```shell
   cd react-ecommerce-store
   npm install
   ```

8. Start the development server for React:
